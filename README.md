# yelp_review_classification

I made this project on a two-person team in Spring 2022 for the course INFO 3350: Text Mining History and Literature.
To see the project methodology and results, see the 'processing_current' notebook. For a breakdown of project member responsibilities, see the responsibility statement text file.

The research questions we explored are the following:
1. How accurately can various algorithms correctly classify star ratings based on review text? What NLP method is most effective for building training data for identifying star ratings based on review text?
   
        - Tf-idf Lemma feature matrices?
        - Average review sentiment feature matrix?
    
3. How accurately can topic modeling paired with various algorithms identify what type of restaurant a review is written about?
   
        - Restaurant vs other type of business?
        - Specific types of restaurants in a multiclass classification?
        - Specific types of restaurants in single-item classification (Mexican or not)?
