# yelp_review_classification

I made this project on a two person team in Spring 2022 for the course INFO 3350: Text Mining History and Literature. The research questions we explored are the following:
    "\n",
    "How accurately can various algorithms correctly classify star rating based on review text?\n",
    "What NLP method is most effective for identifying star numbers based on review text?\n",
    "- Tf-idf Lemma feature matrices?\n",
    "- Average review sentiment feature matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "How accurately can topic modeling paired with various algorithms identify what type of restaurant a review is written about?\n",
    "- Restaurant vs other type of business?\n",
    "- Specific types of restaurants in a multiclass classification?\n",
    "- Specific types of restaurants in single item classification (Mexican or not)?\n",
    "\n",
