# yelp_review_classification

To see the project methodoogy and results, see the 'main_analysis' notebook.

I made this project on a two person team in Spring 2022 for the course INFO 3350: Text Mining History and Literature. The research questions we explored are the following:

How accurately can various algorithms correctly classify star rating based on review text?
What NLP method is most effective for identifying star numbers based on review text?
- Tf-idf Lemma feature matrices?
- Average review sentiment feature matrix?
    
How accurately can topic modeling paired with various algorithms identify what type of restaurant a review is written about?
- Restaurant vs other type of business?
- Specific types of restaurants in a multiclass classification?
- Specific types of restaurants in single item classification (Mexican or not)?
